========

server broadcasts gamestate

server also records the controlstate of each user,
but the control state is not broadcasted

server also checks for and detects consumpotion somehow
tells, everyone which player consumed, which player died, etc

upon new connection,
sends metadata like sizes, color, name

sends leaderboards occasionally
